Frontend for platform, in Ember and SASS.

# Use cases
The tech@nyu platform simplifies common tasks for eboard members. For example, an eboard member can: 
- discover past speakers from tech@nyu events, and filter the list by which events they’ve spoken at (and maybe also their skills, e.g. design, programming, game artistry, etc.). [eboard only urls]
- lists prior tech@nyu venues, and the eboard members connected to each [eboard only urls]
- generate much of the digest automatically
- see all other eboarders’ contact info [eboard only urls]
- add an event to the system; each team can only schedule events on the calendar on certain dates, unless otherwise approved [eboard only urls, team based permissions]
- the system can notify the marketing team about the event, and perhaps automatically create a meet up
- create calendars of our events that people can subscribe to  [public urls]
- report total number of rsvps, total list of speakers for nyu budgeting [operations only url]
- manage job board [3rd party software for this?? include for budget?]
- generate a sign in form for each event [public url]
- add event to calendar, view calendar, edit event
	- maybe events have subscribers to notify marketing
	- for digest. a flag on event that only the marketing team can send.
